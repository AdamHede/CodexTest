# Interactive Web Game Starter

This repository is a clean slate for building a rich interactive web game. It currently hosts a minimal "Hello, world!" experience rendered on an HTML canvas so you can verify that everything is wired correctly before expanding the project.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the greeting drawn onto the canvas. From here you can begin implementing the game's rendering, input handling, and logic in `main.js`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Base HTML shell that loads the game scripts and styles.
- `style.css` – Global styles and layout rules for the game container.
- `main.js` – Entry point for game logic; currently draws the hello world scene.

Feel free to replace or expand these files as the game takes shape.
